# Algorithms implemented throughout my academic life

Here you will find:
- [x] Algorithms implemented by me during courses, workshops, webinars, etc.
- [x] Further information about the events from where these algorithms were developed.
- [x] Reference book and other resource materials (videos, online courses, software links, etc) for further study of each algorithm.
- [x] Laboratory or computational homework slides, if the implemented algorithms come from these materials. Some of these materials (slides+algorithm) might be in a private [git submodules] as they might contain sensitive Professors' computational solutions, which aren't supposed to be available online. In these cases, you cannot access these algorithms as it is restricted to personal consultation.
- [x] Code references developed by others, possibly during the same event where I've built mine. Such references will be in the form of [git submodules]. Such submodules are within the direcory named `other_solutions/`.
- [x] Package references that implement such algorithms.

Here you won't find:
- [ ] Book PDFs or theoretical lectures slides.
- [ ] Software
- [ ] Code solution of Book's computational exercises

## Git-annex for Large files

This repository uses `git-annex` to store any file larger than 50MB in my Google Drive. Any new file larger than that should be stored in `git-annex`. For more info, see [here].
