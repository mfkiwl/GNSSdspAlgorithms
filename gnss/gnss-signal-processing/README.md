# GNSS Signal Processing

This directory contains algorithm solutions for computational exercises on GNSS Signal Processing.
- These algorithms were developed during two events:
  - Galileo Masterclass Brazil (GMB) 2022.
  - The course "GNSS Signal Processing", taught by Prof. Dr. [Felix Antreich], at Aeronautics Institute of Technology, ITA, Brazil.
- The [algorithms] cover the following topics:
  - Code and correlation.
  - Signal Acquisition.
  - Parameter tracking.

## Extra material

- RINEX simulator: generates the code pseudorange, carrier pseudorange, Doppler measurements, C/N_0 estimates, and navigation message. It basically performs the tasks of the GNSS signal processing part and generates the RINEX file, which is used in the GNSS data processing part. You can use any GNSS positioning simulator to process such a RINEX file.
