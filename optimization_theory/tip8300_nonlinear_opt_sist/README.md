# TIP8300 - Otimização não-linear de sistemas

Taught by Yuri Carvalho Barbosa Silva and Tarcisio Ferreira Maciel at UFC.

- [`./exercises/`](./exercises/) contains theoretical/computational exercises.
- [`computational_homeworks`](./computational_homeworks/) contains the computational homework used in this discipline.
  - Two computational homeworks were given: `OtimizacaoRelaxacaoQuadratica.ipynb` and `lamps.ipynb`. In `OtimizacaoRelaxacaoQuadratica.ipynb`, the description and the Python code were provided by the Professor. In `lamps.ipynb`, the description and the Matlab code were provided by the Professor. In both cases, the Julia code is my solution.
  - The computational homework is basically to solve optimization problems by using optimization packages. I used the Julia programming language and the [`Convex.jl`](https://github.com/jump-dev/Convex.jl) package to solve it.
- The slides used in this course are the same as the course "[EE364a: Convex Optimization I][1]", taught by Stephen Boyd, form Stanford University. Ihave such slides materials saved in my Google Drive (see `./Math - Numerical Methods/Convex optimization/`), but you can also find them in [lecture slides tab][2].
