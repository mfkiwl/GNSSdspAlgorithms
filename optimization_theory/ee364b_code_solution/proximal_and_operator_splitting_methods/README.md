This comes from [EE364b: Lecture Slides and Notes][1] -> Proximal algorithms (paper and code) -> [Proximal Algorithms][2]. The two main sources are
- A submodule for proximal operators.
- [MATLAB scripts for proximal methods][3]: This page gives Matlab implementations of the examples in our paper on proximal algorithms. All the scripts require CVX for comparison purposes. You can use the grabcode function built in to MATLAB to obtain the code. Please report any issues to the authors.
- Codes for Monotone operator splitting methods.
- Distributed Optimization and Statistical Learning via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM): This part is too long so it is simply not reasonable to get everything. It follows the important links to find yourself in ADMM:
  - [ADMM][4]
  - [Distributed Optimization and Statistical Learning via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers][5]

As always, only the codes are stored here. You won't find theorerical PDF slides, Thesis, or books.
