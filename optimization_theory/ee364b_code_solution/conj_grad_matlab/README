egwithpoly.m -- plots the optimal polynomials for conjugate gradient
method for a 7x7 system.
resistivenet.m -- solves a large resistive circuit using conjugate 
gradient and preconditioned conjugate gradient methods.
l2_logreg.m -- truncated Newton solver for l2-regularized logistic 
regression.
tnm_normg_vs_tntiter.m -- solves l2 regularized logistic regression 
problem using using (exact) Newton, truncated 
Newton (with and without preconditioning)
large_scale_flow_control.m -- solves a large-scale flow control 
problem by truncated Newton interior-point method
