# Artificial Intelligence

This is an umbrella directory which contains all sort of algorithms related to Artificial Intelligence (AI). While each subdirectory contains algorithms implemented in a event (courses, workshops, webinars, etc) and their respective theoretical and technical references, this directory's `README.md` file contains:

- Technical references (software, packages, frameworks, datasets) which might be common to all courses.
- Extra references on the AI and MLOps career.

## Technical references
