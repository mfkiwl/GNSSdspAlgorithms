# Artificial Intelligence

This is an umbrella directory which containsall sort of algorithms related to Artificial Intelligence (AI). While each subdirectory contains algorithms implemented in a event (courses, workshops, webinars, etc) with their respective references, this `README.md` file contains technical references which might be common to all courses.
