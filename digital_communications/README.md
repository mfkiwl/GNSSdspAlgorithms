# Digital Communication

This directory contains:
  - The homework from my course "Sistemas de Comunicação Digitais", which was taught at UFC.
  - The homework is essentially the development of a digital modem under the presence of noise.
  - The digital model is implemented in Simulink.
  - The reference modem is in the private repo.
